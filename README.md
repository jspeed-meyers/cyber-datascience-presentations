## Cybersecurity Data Science Presentations Analysis

### Motivation

The field of cybersecurity data science (applications of data-intensive techniques often involving statist$
machine learning to cybersecurity problems) is nascent and fast moving. This is both exciting and confusin$
because there are a range of new, interesting, and promising approaches to cybersecurity problems. It's co$
this field is disparate and inchoate, making assessment difficult. This small effort is an attempt to cata$
of cybersecurity data science research: recent conference presentations.

For a blog post that describes this effort, see [here](https://www.google.com).

### Data and code

For both a raw and cleaned version of the cybersecurity data science presentation dataset, see the data fo$
notebook that cleans and then analyzes this dataset, see the "csds_presentations.ipynb" file.

### Findings

```
From my blog post on this topic:

The analysis finds that supervised machine learning on malware (malicious software) is the
modal topic-method combination. The focus on malware and supervised learning could be due
to availability of large, labeled datasets, which is arguably enabled by the ability of
researchers to access large datasets of software files, easily label software as benign or
malicious, avoid privacy concerns, and develop predictive models with at least a moderate
capability to transfer from one context to another. Itâ€™s worth pointing out though that
cybersecurity data science in fact has many other topics and more methods than supervised
machine learning. In other words, the field could even be deemed healthy...

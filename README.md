## Cybersecurity Data Science Presentations Analysis

### Overview

The field of cybersecurity data science (applications of data-intensive techniques often involving statistics and 
machine learning to cybersecurity problems) is nascent and fast moving. This is both exciting and confusing. It's exciting
because there are a range of new, interesting, and promising approaches to cybersecurity problems. It's confusing because
this field is disparate and inchoate, making assessment difficult. This small effort is an attempt to catalogue one mode
of cybersecurity data science research: recent conference presentations.

For a blog post that describes this effort, see [here](https://medium.com/in-q-tel/a-panoramic-view-of-one-small-slice-of-cybersecurity-data-science-853a136bd106).

### Data and code

For both a raw and cleaned version of the cybersecurity data science presentation dataset, see the data folder. For a Jupyter
notebook that cleans and then analyzes this dataset, see the "csds_presentations.ipynb" file.

### Motivation

```
From my blog post on this topic:

An observer can be forgiven for believing that cybersecurity, data science, and especially
cybersecurity data science are immature fields. The cybersecurity field is nascent enough
that the National Security Agency (NSA) sponsors the Science of Security Initiative (see
their annual best-paper competition) to explicitly “mature” this area of research. Data science
— a field so wide-ranging that I hesitate to offer a definition — is arguably even less
mature than cybersecurity. If cybersecurity is a young adult, then data science is a
wide-eyed middle schooler. So, how can the field of cybersecurity data science move
towards analytical adulthood? One step in the right direction might involve some reflection
on recent developments. For instance, what are the topic areas within this field? What
research methods are commonly employed? What methods are paired with what research areas?
And, most tentatively, what explains any patterns of research activity?
